// Power gate — the low-battery defense for the LiPo + boost supply (see the
// battery section of the sport's sport_config.h). Two detection paths share
// one outcome (flashed warning screen + deep sleep):
//   voltage:  a divider on BATTERY_SENSE_PIN is read at power-on — the only
//             moment ADC2 is free, Wi-Fi claims it afterwards — and
//             at/below BATTERY_LOW_VOLTS the board flashes the warning and
//             sleeps immediately, before any cycling can start. While
//             asleep it silently re-checks every BATTERY_RECHECK_MS and
//             resumes on its own once the charger lifts the pack past
//             BATTERY_RESUME_VOLTS.
//   backstop: with no divider wired, an NVS boot journal counts rapid bad
//             boots (brownout resets / sessions that never reached
//             BATTERY_HEALTHY_BOOT_MS of uptime); a streak of
//             BATTERY_BAD_BOOT_STREAK trips the same path. Recovery then
//             needs a power cycle after charging.
